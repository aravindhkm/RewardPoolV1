Contract logic:
1. Main contract: 0x6195D22d416E2D2c7C4A883c977Dd9Bfd4e65432
2. Mechanism: There will be selling slippage every time sell, and the fee (METADAO) received will enter the dividend contract: 
0xcf35D5Cd51Bccbd54F8aD5E9164c98F2666c643E
3. The dividend contract will send or deduct the corresponding amount of TokenTracker synchronously according to the amount of METADAO held by all wallets: METADAO_Dividend
4. After selling METADAO, the dividend contract will obtain USDT. At the same time, according to the obtained USDT, the USDT due to each wallet will be recorded according to the proportion of the TokenTracker held, and it will be recorded in the pending dividends to each wallet.
5. Every time there is a wallet for swap, the pending dividends of each wallet will be queried in order, If it reaches 3Usdt, it will be automatically distributed by the dividend contract



Hacker info:
1. Hacker wallet: 0xfd3e48f1bc5d74ae299a2b5b2e6c87bccce44c94
2. The contract created by the hacker: 
0xdbf79fc588f30e73b9e8ca2f7dbe0bcb5ea1c3e6


Hacking method:
1. He performs a similar authorization behavior for the contract he created:

2. Then do the following:

Explanation: 
Once Usdt enters the dividend contract, his contract will immediately make the same transaction
1.The contract he created will automatically create a new temporary contract wallet, such as this in txid: 0x8aa969Cc4c6CC5ea74Be1edd0a22b639a24F439C
2.His wallet will transfer 0.1BNB to the authorized contract, and then the contract will transfer 0.1BNB to the temporary contract
3.Temporary contract transfers buy 1 METADAO from liquidity through RouterV2 and get 1 TokenTracker dividend, liquidity: 
0xb1D777ddF03188116F60Ba795F04F9F99e737baB
4.The remaining BNB will be returned to the temporary contract
5.Then at the same txid, the temporary contract sells 1 METADAO, and the dividend wallet will distribute all USDT (belonging to all holders) in the wallet to the temporary contract, and finally transfer them to the hacker wallet
6.The BNB received from selling 1 METADAO and the remaining BNB will be transferred to the hacker's wallet
7.Finally, his contract will destroy the created temporary contract, and next time it will create a new temporary wallet for the same operation

The key to the problem:
1.The temporary contract has only 1 METADAO and 1 TokenTracker, so its proportion is very small. Even if the dividend wallet gets 30U, it should only be calculated as negligible USDT, such as 0.000001 USDT, which is too little
2.However, its temporary contract does a special behavior. Its 0.000001 USDT is multiplied many times, which is equal to the amount of USDT in the dividend wallet, that is, 30.61 USDT. All other wallets will also be multiplied by the same times (so the pending dividends in each wallet have become particularly large)
3.However, because its temporary contract sold 1 METADAO at the same time, according to the contract logic, the seller's dividend will be distributed first, so all the USDT in the dividend contract will be transferred to it.
The biggest problem is:
When the dividend wallet swap METADAO to USDT and according to the tracker to calculate the USDT that each wallet deserves, the amount of pending dividends in all wallets is multiplied many times! !
